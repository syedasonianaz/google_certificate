# Google Advanced Data Analytics Capstone Project  

This repository contains my capstone project for the **Google Advanced Data Analytics Certificate**, where I applied advanced data analytics and machine learning techniques to solve a real-world problem.

## Project Overview  
- **Goal:** The goal of this project was to predict employee attrition based on various factors such as satisfaction level, evaluation scores, number of projects, average monthly hours, tenure, and other employee characteristics. By building a predictive model, the objective was to provide actionable insights to HR for better employee retention strategies.  
- **Key Skills Used:**  
  - Python  
  - Data Cleaning and Visualization  
  - Machine Learning  
  - Predictive Modeling  

## Features  
1. **Data Analysis**: In-depth exploration of the dataset to uncover trends and insights, such as the relationship between satisfaction level and employee attrition, and the impact of tenure and promotions on employee retention.  
2. **Machine Learning Model**: Built and evaluated a classification model (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting) to predict whether an employee would leave the company (based on the 'left' column).  
3. **Visualizations**: Created insightful visualizations using Matplotlib and Seaborn, including correlation heatmaps, distribution plots, and feature importance charts to understand employee behavior and the factors influencing attrition.

## Tools and Technologies  
- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Scikit-learn  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- Jupyter Notebooks  

## Results  
Achieved an **AUC-ROC score of 86%**, demonstrating the effectiveness of the model in predicting employee attrition. The analysis highlighted key factors influencing attrition, such as job satisfaction and tenure, and provided actionable recommendations for HR to improve employee retention strategies.
